# Configuration-file for pre-commit
#
# References:
#   - Official docs: https://pre-commit.com
#   - for more hooks: https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html
#   - https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
#
# Notes:
#   - To avoid duplication, we try to configure the tools in pyproject.toml as much as possible.
#   - The setting "language: system" is used to run commands that are already available on your system,
#     and pre-commit does not need to create or manage an isolated environment.
#   - Single-quote regular expressions.
#
# Usage:
#   > bin/pre-commit install
#   > bin/pre-commit install hooks -f
#   > bin/pre-commit autoupdate
#   > bin/pre-commit run --all-files
